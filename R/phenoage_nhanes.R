#' @title phenoage_nhanes
#' @description Train Phenotypic Age algorithm in NHANES III and project into NHANES IV.
#' @param biomarkers A character vector indicating the names of the biomarkers included in the Phenotypic Age algorithm.
#' @return An object of class "phenoage". This object is a list with two elements (data and fit). The dataset can be drawn by typing 'data'. The model can be drawn by typing 'fit'.
